# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

 At the first day of class there are 35 students in Math Statistics class and professor Brownlow always proposes this bet to his students "I will wager $2 to your bet of $1 that at least two people in today's class have  the same birthday.  He tells me he has made that bet 1137 times so far. Where do you think his profits are? Discuss this in a markdown document

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  In this section explain the approach you will take to attack the issue --- how will you decide on a likely estimate of professor Brownlow's earnings or losses after 1137 bets. Also explain how you construct a 95% confidence interval about your estimate of his winnings !-->


#Profit Estimate

<!--Explain and display the results of your method of coming up with the estimate of professor Brownlows betting!-->
```{r}
bdays <- 1:365
m <- 0
for(i in 1:1137){
   class <- sample(x=bdays, size = 35,replace=TRUE)
   dc <- duplicated(class)
   dc2 <- sum(dc)
   if(dc2==0) {
     m <- m-2
   }
   if(dc2!=0)
     m <- m + 1 
}
print(m)
```


Brownlow made an estimate of $500 in the 1137 bets he made. First I created an R code that will allow us to get an estimate of the profits Brownlow has made so far. First I created a vector named bday that contained numbers from 1 to 365 to represent how many days in a year. A loop was created where the vector, class, took 35 samples and replaced them. Class was then duplicated and placed in a vector named, dc. Then a vector named dc2 contained the sum of dc. Then an argument was created where if dc2=0 then two dollars would be subtracted from the total amount of money. Also if dc2 didn't equal 0 then one dollar would be added to the total amount of money.

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If professor Brownlow is consistantly making or losing money how could he change his payout so that his profits center on zero?  Also discuss what size his class should be in order to have his current scheme balance at zero profit.!-->
